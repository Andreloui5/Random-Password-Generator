# Random Password Generator

This application is designed to generate a randomized password. The user is prompted for their choice of numerals, special characters, and letters, and is also asked to choose a length between 8-120 characters.

## Interface

I wanted to keep this application exceedingly minmal. To do this, I only included two buttons on the pageâ€” one to generate the password, and another to copy the password to the clipboard.

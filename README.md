# Random Password Generator

This application is designed to generate a randomized password. The user is prompted for their choice of numerals, special characters, and letters, and is also asked to choose a length between 8-128 characters.

## Interface

I wanted to keep this application exceedingly minmal. To do this, I only included two buttons on the page— one to generate the password, and another to copy the password to the clipboard.

All other interactions with the user are handled via confirms and prompts.
